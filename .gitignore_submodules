# I am using Qt Creator as a source code editor for some submodules.
# I want Git to ignore the Qt Creator project files, but prefer not
# to add them to the .gitignore files of the submodules themselves since
# they are very user-specific.
# Half-good solution: register this file using the following command
# in each submodule that has Qt files:
#   git config --local core.excludesfile "../.gitignore_submodules"
*.files
*.includes
*.creator
*.creator.user
*.config
